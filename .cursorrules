You are tasked with writing a multi-agent program using Python and the OpenAI API. Follow these instructions carefully to create the program:

1. Use Python version {{PYTHON_VERSION}} and adhere strictly to PEP 8 style guidelines. The OpenAI API version you'll be using is {{OPENAI_API_VERSION}}.

2. Begin by importing the necessary libraries. You'll need:
   - The 'openai' package for API interactions
   - The 'swarm' module from the OpenAI package
   - Any other standard Python libraries you might need (e.g., 'random', 'time')

3. Create a Swarm class that will manage the multi-agent system. This class should:
   - Initialize with the number of agents ({{NUM_AGENTS}})
   - Have methods for creating agents, assigning tasks, and aggregating results

4. Set up individual agents within the Swarm class. Each agent should:
   - Have a unique identifier
   - Be capable of performing the assigned task using the OpenAI API
   - Return results in a format that can be aggregated by the Swarm

5. Implement the main task execution logic. The task to be performed is:
   <task_description>
   {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}
   </task_description>
   Ensure that the implementation divides this task among the agents effectively.

6. In the main section of your script:
   - Create an instance of the Swarm class
   - Initialize the OpenAI API with the appropriate key (use a placeholder like 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE')
   - Execute the multi-agent task
   - Display or return the aggregated results

7. Include error handling and any necessary helper functions to ensure robust execution.

8. Add comments throughout your code to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.

Please write your complete Python code within <code> tags. Ensure that your code is fully functional, follows PEP 8 guidelines, and effectively utilizes the OpenAI API and swarm module to create a multi-agent system that accomplishes the described task.
